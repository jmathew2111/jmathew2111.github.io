I was doing many different jobs. I was working the warehouse, and machine shops that involved allot of physical labor and coming home with dirty hands and dirty clothing. But there were some things that I liked about these jobs. One of those things that I enjoyed was the technical side. I enjoyed building, creating, and the organizational aspect of it all. But here is the problem if you cut a piece of wood wrong you cannot fix it. I wanted to build, create, and innovate without all the physical hard labor and dirt in my hands and the hard consequences of mistakes.
